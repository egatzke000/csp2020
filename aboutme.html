		<font size="5" color="green">My name is Emma Gatzke. I'm 17 years old and I competitively swim. I enjoy painting, running, and biking. This year I want to learn as much as I can and stay on top of things before college. I like any comedy, horror, or romance, and my current favorite show is The Office. I listen to pretty much any music as long as it's good.</font>
